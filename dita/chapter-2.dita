            <p>While the bears were away a little girl called Goldilocks, who lived at the other
                side of the wood and had been sent on an errand by her mother, passed by the house,
                and looked in at the window. </p>

            <p>And then she peeped in at the keyhole, for she was not at all a well-brought-up
                little girl. Then seeing nobody in the house she lifted the latch. </p>
            <p>The door was not fastened<ph audience="child">, because the Bears were good Bears,
                    who did nobody any harm, and never suspected that anybody would harm them</ph>.
                So Goldilocks opened the door and went in; and well pleased was she when she saw the
                porridge on the table. </p>
            <p>If she had been a <ph audience="child">well-brought-up</ph><ph audience="adult">smart

                    for all that very good-natured and hospitable</ph>. But she was a<ph
